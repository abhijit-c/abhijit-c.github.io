You teach a class with a computational component, and you want to distribute code to your students. The average student in these classes at best has exposure to MATLAB, or maybe Mathematica. But, the reality is that an increasing majority of mathematical research is being done in Python, not to mention that it’s obviously massively applicable to industry. I like my students. I want them to succeed. I want them to learn and use Python.</p> <p>Naively, I write some nice Python code. Clean, readable, beautiful visualizations. I hand them the files. With wonder, curiosity, and hope, they say “Cool! How do I run this?”.</p> <p>Isn’t it insane that I have to snuff out the life in eyes on step one?</p> <p>Okay, I could use something like Google Colab. I suppose I understand why so many people in my field are comfortable with notebooks, what with that being the easiest way to run a simple script. Otherwise, I’m staring down the barrel of explaining 1) how to get Python on your system to begin with and why that shouldn’t be something like yout system’s package manager, 3) why, for our scientific computing ecosystem, we have to use packages off of conda-forge instead of PyPI (mostly), and 3) conda itself. Each of those are uncomfortable conversations when I’m trying to convince them to use a different tool that’s basically a 1-click install. Compounding the problem, sometimes I have to begin with explaining what a terminal is.</p> <p>Well, Pixi doesn’t exactly fix this. I should just wrap up this post give them notebooks. But, I hate notebooks. They’re great for exploration, or tutorials. But, their format inherently encourages bad programming practices and students, who haven’t seen anything else, end up writing monster notebooks. I debugged multiple such specimens during my PhD years, trying to strip out the critical pieces for my own research. I want them to see better ways to do things.</p> <h1 id="pixi">Pixi</h1> <p><a href="https://pixi.sh/latest/">Pixi</a> is a new(-ish) package manager that operates off of conda-forge. That’s critical for scientific computing, given how many dependencies in our field are enormous C/C++/Fortran libraries. PyPI is great for Python packages, but it explicitly isn’t designed for such projects. Otherwise, I would happily be using <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a>.</p> <p>Why not just use Conda? I actually don’t have big problems with it, especially after mamba mostly solved the performance issues. However, it’s far from a seamless experience; there’s a lot of intermediate steps and manual intervention required to set up a new enviornment. Not to mention it drapes itself all over your system and paths, which causes problems for other tools. For example, <a href="https://www.firedrakeproject.org/">Firedrake</a>, an excellent finite element library, specifically calls out conda as an anti-requirement. Furthermore, most people I know just ad-hoc install packages into enviornments. More often than note, I find existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env.yml</code> to be outdated, or just plain wrong.</p> <p>In contrast, Pixi is faster, doesn’t pull any path shenanigans (it’s just a binary), and is specifically designed to integrate into workspaces. If I want to pass some code to students, I toss them repository with the files, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pixi.toml</code></p> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pixi.lock</code>, and a README with a command or two.</li> </ul> <p>Recently, I took steps to completely clean my system of Conda (unsurprisingly annoying, but therapeutic), and now I’m using Pixi exclusively for my research. I’m happy to say, atleast in PDE (FEniCS) and neural network land (PyTorch \&amp; JAX), it has been a smooth transition. I’m very much looking forward to the completion of rattler-build, so that it’s easier to push packages to conda-forge as well.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal"/><category term="math,"/><category term="python,"/><category term="pixi"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The python packaging system is insane.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello, World!</title><link href="https://abhijit-c.github.io/blog/2025/hello-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello, World!"/><published>2025-05-06T17:37:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T17:37:00+00:00</updated><id>https://abhijit-c.github.io/blog/2025/hello-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://abhijit-c.github.io/blog/2025/hello-world/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="youve-landed-on-my-blog">You’ve landed on my blog!</h1> <p>Welcome!
