I've accepted a postdoctoral position at Tufts University! I'll be working with
[Dr. Elizabeth Newmann](https://elizabethnewman.owlstown.net/) in scientific
machine learning, optimization, deep learning, uncertainty quantification,
(Bayesian) inverse problems, reduced order modeling, high-performance computing,
or other related fields.
