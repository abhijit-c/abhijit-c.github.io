***Note:*** If you're seeing this, my apologies, the website is under
constrution. It should be finished by the end of the day!

I am a computational mathematician and my research interests lie in wielding
math to design algorithms for real-world problems.
Currently, I practice that in developing scalable algorithms to quantify,
analyze, and control the uncertainty inherent in mathematical models.
Previously, I focused on the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of large-scale
inverse problems for physical phenomena governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs).
At the moment, I'm pursuing new directions in computational science, generally
along the lines of problem structure-exploiting neural architecutres and
algorithms.

Outside of math, I enjoy Dungeons and Dragons / Pathfinder with friends across
the continent, playing fighting games, and generally am very into computers.
You might see me around Boston if you're in any of the local coffee shops,
or any convention / competition running a Tekken bracket!
